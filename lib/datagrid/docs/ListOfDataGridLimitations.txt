It's a cost for versatility through effectiveness.

    Resize property for all "Simple" textareas disappears, if "WYSIWYG" text area was defined before.
Browsers: IE 6/7

    that all "Simple" will be first and all "WYSIWYG" will be underneath.

   
[#004] [Issue]  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Don't use a virtual field for sorting or simply comment Issue [#123] : start/end lines of code in datagrid.class.php

    DataGrids working on one page in Master-Details structure. It may lead to

[#009] [Limitation] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If in defining ENUM values in database used apostrophes (single quotes - for ex.: editor''s award),
    the ENUM field type with "source"=>"self" doesn't work properly, because in database it saved
    as 'editor''s award'.
Solution:
    Create and use foreign keys, linked to the separate table with ENUM values.


[#014] [Limitation] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:      
    Using of "show_count"=>true attribute in filtering dropdown lists works only for
